### The most substantial simplification can be achieved by **changing the core concept of what a CascadeLayer represents.**

### Currently, the architecture performs a two-step merge:

1. ### **Intra-Layer Merge:** All individual .json files within a single layer's folder (e.g., config/1\_base/) are merged into a single, unified DomNode tree for that layer.

2. ### **Display Merge:** These unified layer trees are then merged together to create the final view in the UI.

### This design forces a very complex "re-splitting" operation during saving, which is the primary source of the system's brittleness and complexity.

### Here is a breakdown of the problem and a proposed, simpler conceptual model.

### ---

## **The Source of Complexity: The Intra-Layer Merge**

### The fundamental issue is the decision to merge all files *within* a layer into a single ObjectNode (LayerConfigRootNode).

* ### **Complex Loading:** The IntraLayerMerger service is needed to combine multiple source files, and it must contain logic to detect and report overlapping definitions (e.g., when app-settings.json and features.json both try to define the same top-level property). 1111

* ### **Complex Origin Tracking:** To save changes correctly, the system must remember exactly which original file a property came from. This is the entire purpose of the    IntraLayerValueOrigins dictionary. 2222

* ### **Extremely Complex Saving:** The ProjectSaver has the hardest job. It can't just save the layer's DomNode. It has to consult the    IntraLayerValueOrigins map to figure out which properties from the unified tree need to be "re-split" and written back to their original files (app-settings.json, features.json, etc.). 3333 This logic is fragile, especially when new properties are added.

## **The Proposed Simplification: Treat Each File as an Atomic Unit**

### Instead of merging files within a layer, **treat each source file as its own independent, atomic DOM tree.** This eliminates the need for the "intra-layer merge" and its corresponding "re-splitting" on save.

### Here's how the new, simpler data flow would work:

1. ### **Redefine CascadeLayer:** A CascadeLayer no longer contains a merged LayerConfigRootNode. Instead, it is simply a named container holding the list of its SourceFileInfo objects. The     SourceFileInfo class, which already holds the DomRoot for a single file, becomes the primary unit of data. 4

2. ### **Eliminate IntraLayerMerger:** This service is no longer needed and can be deleted entirely. The ProjectLoader will now simply parse files and group them into their respective CascadeLayer containers without merging them.

3. ### **Simplify CascadedDomDisplayMerger:** The display merger's job remains, but its input changes. Instead of receiving a list of pre-merged CascadeLayers, it receives a flat list of *all* SourceFileInfo objects from all layers, ordered by layer priority. It merges these atomic DOMs into the final tree for display. The core logic of merging one node over another remains the same.

4. ### **Drastically Simplify ProjectSaver:** Saving becomes trivial. To save a layer, you iterate through its SourceFileInfo objects. If a file's DOM tree is dirty, you serialize that DomRoot directly to its FilePath. There is no more re-splitting, and the complex IntraLayerValueOrigins map is no longer needed.

5. ### **Simplify Edit Handling:** When a user edits a node in the UI, the origin tracking will now point directly to the specific SourceFileInfo object that owns the node. The change is made directly to that file's DomRoot, which is a much clearer and more direct operation.

## **What to Change in the Codebase**

### Here's a summary of the key changes required to implement this simplification:

* ### **Core/Cascade/CascadeLayer.cs**

  * ### Remove the      LayerConfigRootNode property. 5

  * ### Remove the      IntraLayerValueOrigins property. 6

  * ### The IsDirty flag would now be a calculated property that checks if any(SourceFiles.IsDirty) (assuming SourceFileInfo gets an IsDirty flag).

* ### **Core/Services/IntraLayerMerger.cs**

  * ### **This service can be deleted entirely.**

* ### **Core/Services/ProjectLoader.cs**

  * ### The LoadProjectAsync method would no longer call the IntraLayerMerger. It would simply create      CascadeLayer instances and populate their SourceFiles list. 7777

* ### **Core/Services/ProjectSaver.cs**

  * ### This service's logic would be completely replaced. The new SaveLayerAsync would look like this:

  * ### C\#

### public async Task SaveLayerAsync(CascadeLayer layer)

### {

###     foreach (var sourceFile in layer.SourceFiles.Where(f \=\> f.IsDirty))

###     {

###         var newContent \= \_serializer.SerializeToString(sourceFile.DomRoot);

###         if (newContent \!= sourceFile.OriginalText)

###         {

###             await File.WriteAllTextAsync(sourceFile.FilePath, newContent);

###             // Update OriginalText and reset IsDirty flag on the sourceFile

###         }

###     }

### }

* ### 

  * ### 

* ### **Core/Services/CascadedDomDisplayMerger.cs**

  * ### The MergeForDisplay method signature would change from MergeForDisplay(IReadOnlyList\<CascadeLayer\> layers, ...) to something like MergeForDisplay(IReadOnlyList\<SourceFileInfo\> allFiles, ...).

* ### **ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs**

  * ### The logic for loading, saving, and editing would be updated to work with SourceFileInfo as the primary editable unit instead of the now-nonexistent LayerConfigRootNode.

  * ### Finding the "real node" to modify would mean finding the correct SourceFileInfo and then the node within its DomRoot.

## **Benefits of This Approach**

* ### ✅ **Reduced Complexity:** You completely eliminate the complex and fragile logic of merging files within a layer and then re-splitting them on save.

* ### ✅ **Improved Robustness:** Saving is no longer dependent on a complex origin map. Adding, removing, or renaming files becomes much easier to handle. The "no overlaps" rule within a layer is no longer needed, as files are inherently separate.

* ### ✅ **Easier Debugging:** The in-memory data structure more closely mirrors the physical file structure, making it much easier to reason about the state of the application.

* ### ✅ **Clearer Data Flow:** The flow becomes a simple Load \-\> Merge for Display \-\> Edit Source \-\> Save Source. The complex Load \-\> Merge \-\> Merge \-\> Edit \-\> Un-Merge \-\> Save cycle is gone.
