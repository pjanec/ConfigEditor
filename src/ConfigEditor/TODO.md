BUG: Adding array node of type object (defined by schema) - now a generic value is created, json type probably deduced just from the string input.
Empty object should be created.

BUG: Folding/unfolding takes long time on little json files.

FEAT: Insert key for adding new stuff into array. Insert item in context menu. Inserts ABOVE selected array item.

BUG: Editor allows editing the Value field of a object-typed schema node
